// Badge criteria evaluation — reads BadgeDefinitions owned by the task's NGO
// from Appwrite and matches them against an action.
//
// Currently supported criteria types:
//   - task-completion : matches every approved claim for any task owned by the org
//   - task-specific   : matches when the claim's taskId equals definition.taskId
//
// Reserved for future work (definitions exist but auto-award is a no-op):
//   - time-based, milestone, custom — these need additional fields on
//     BadgeDefinition (e.g. maxMinutes, taskCount, customLogic) before the
//     engine can match them. Until then, defs with these criteria are stored
//     but never auto-awarded.
